    "what does the dox say": "It seems you might be referring to the song \"The Fox (What Does The Fox Say?)\" by Ylvis, a Norwegian comedy duo. The song humorously attempts to answer the question of what noise a fox makes, which is not commonly known. Its gibberish sounds like, \"Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!\" have become popular worldwide. However, if you're referring to something else, kindly provide me with more information so I can assist you better."
